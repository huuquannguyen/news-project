## NEWS PROJECT
This website allows the owners to write news and upload it to the internet for people to consume the content.
The owners can flexibly make update on any news they have written.
People who use this website for reading news can leave their comments at the bottom of a news, but first they need an account to do that.

# NOTE
I am developing another website about recuitment and jobs searching which is based on this news posting website.
For some reasons I have to keep the repository in private mode.
Here is the demo version of that website (deploy using AWS)
